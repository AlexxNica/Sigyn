# Sigyn

A Limnoria plugin to handle spam and abuse on a network level

Sigyn is developed primarily for the freenode irc network. As with most of
freenode's utility bots, Sigyn is named after a [Norse goddess]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigyn)

# Installation

If you're running this on a production network, you should probably use the
latest stable release. The master branch is considered unstable and may break at
any time.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/freenode/Sigyn/wiki) for setup instructions
and commands, as well as a work-in-progress configuration manual.
